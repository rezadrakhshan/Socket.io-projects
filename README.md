# Socket.IO Projects

This repository contains two real-time web application projects built with **Socket.IO**. Each project demonstrates how WebSockets can be used to create interactive, live experiences on the web.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game built with Socket.IO. Two players can join and play in real-time. The game state is synchronized between clients via WebSockets.

<!-- Example: https://tic-tac-toe-demo.vercel.app -->

### 2. WhatsApp Clonner

A simple real-time chat application inspired by WhatsApp. Users can join and send messages instantly. Messages are transmitted using Socket.IO and rendered using EJS templates.
